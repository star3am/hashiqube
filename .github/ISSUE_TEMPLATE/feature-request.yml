      description: "Clear description of the feature you'd like to see"
      placeholder: |
        **What feature would you like:**
        Add support for HashiCorp HCP (HashiCorp Cloud Platform) integration to demonstrate cloud-native HashiCorp services alongside the self-hosted versions.

        **Why would this be useful:**
        It would help users understand the differences between self-hosted and cloud-managed HashiCorp services, providing a complete learning experience.

      description: "What problem does this feature solve? How would you use it?"
      placeholder: |
        **Problem:**
        Currently HashiQube only demonstrates self-hosted HashiCorp tools, but many organizations use cloud-managed services.

        **Use Case:**
        I want to learn about both deployment models and understand when to choose self-hosted vs. cloud-managed HashiCorp services.

        **Benefit:**
        This would provide a comprehensive learning experience covering all HashiCorp deployment options and help users make informed decisions.

      label: üí° Proposed Solution
      description: "How do you think this feature should work?"
      placeholder: |
        **Implementation idea:**
        - Add new component directory: `hcp/` with setup scripts
        - Create configuration templates for HCP services
        - Add documentation comparing self-hosted vs. cloud options

        **Integration approach:**
        - Provide HCP API examples alongside local CLI examples
        - Show how to connect local tools to HCP services
        - Include cost and feature comparison guides

      description: "Have you considered any alternative solutions or workarounds?"
      placeholder: |
        **Current workarounds:**
        - Setting up separate HCP accounts manually
        - Using external documentation and tutorials
        - Creating custom scripts for HCP integration

        **Why they're not ideal:**
        - Not integrated with HashiQube learning environment
        - Requires separate setup and configuration
        - Doesn't provide side-by-side comparison experience
