        # 🔗 Component Integration Issue

        Thank you for reporting an integration issue! This template is for problems with **HashiCorp component integration, inter-component communication, or workflow issues** between different tools in HashiQube.

        ## 📋 When to use this template:
        - ✅ Components work individually but not together
        - ✅ Service discovery or networking issues between components
        - ✅ Authentication/authorization problems between tools
        - ✅ Data flow or communication issues
        - ✅ Configuration conflicts between components
        - ✅ Workflow or orchestration problems

        ## ❌ When NOT to use this template:
        - 🚫 **Single component issues**: One tool not working → Use "Bug Report" template
        - 🚫 **Platform issues**: Environment problems → Use "Platform Compatibility" template
        - 🚫 **Setup help**: Need configuration assistance → Use "Support & Setup Help" template

      placeholder: |
        **What integration should work:**
        Nomad should be able to retrieve secrets from Vault for job deployments

        **What's actually happening:**
        Nomad jobs fail with authentication errors when trying to access Vault

        **Expected workflow:**
        1. Nomad job requests secret from Vault
        2. Vault authenticates Nomad using Consul service identity
        3. Vault returns secret to Nomad
        4. Nomad uses secret in job deployment

        **Actual behavior:**
        - Nomad job fails at step 2 with "permission denied"
        - Vault logs show authentication failure
        - Consul shows services are registered correctly

      placeholder: |
        1. Start HashiQube with: vagrant up --provision-with basetools,vault,consul,nomad
        2. Verify all services are running: vault status, consul members, nomad status
        3. Configure Vault-Consul integration: vault auth enable consul
        4. Deploy test Nomad job that requires Vault secret: nomad job run test-job.hcl
        5. Observe job failure in Nomad UI or logs
        6. Check Vault audit logs for authentication attempts

        **Configuration changes tried:**
        - Modified Vault auth method configuration
        - Adjusted Consul ACL policies
        - Changed Nomad Vault integration settings

        **Troubleshooting steps:**
        - Restarted services in different orders
        - Checked service registration in Consul
        - Verified network connectivity between components
        - Reviewed authentication tokens and policies

        **Temporary workarounds:**
        - Using static secrets instead of dynamic
        - Bypassing Vault integration temporarily
        - Manual token generation for testing
